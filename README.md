### These are my first work projects that use an Arduino OPTA device, written in C++. ###
###  The Modbus project has the Server role in a Client/Server communication and has its own IP address and port. ###
###  It uses Coils and Discrete Inputs to read and interpret input, allowing remote control over the programâ€™s actions. ###
